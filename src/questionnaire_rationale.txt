# Friendship Compatibility Assessment - Scientific Rationale & Scoring System

## 1. Time Investment & Availability
**Question:** "How many hours per week do you typically spend with close friends?"
- **Scientific Basis:** Social investment theory and longitudinal friendship studies (Hall, 2019) show that time availability is the strongest predictor of friendship formation and maintenance.
- **Scoring Logic:**
  - Perfect Match (3 points): Same value selected
  - Good Match (2 points): Adjacent values (e.g., 3-5 hours and 6-10 hours)
  - Poor Match (0 points): Two or more intervals apart
  - **Rationale:** People with vastly different social time budgets struggle to maintain consistent friendship interactions.

## 2. Conflict Resolution Style
**Question:** "When disagreeing with a friend, how do you typically handle it?"
- **Scientific Basis:** Based on attachment theory and conflict resolution research (Gottman, 2015), showing that matching or complementary conflict styles predict relationship longevity.
- **Scoring Logic:**
  - Complementary Styles (3 points):
    - "Address immediately" + "Wait to calm down"
    - "Seek external advice" + "Wait to calm down"
  - Compatible Styles (2 points):
    - "Wait to calm down" + "Wait to calm down"
    - "Address immediately" + "Seek external advice"
  - Incompatible Styles (0 points):
    - "Avoid confrontation" + "Address immediately"
  - **Rationale:** Some conflict styles naturally complement each other, while others create friction.

## 3. Social Energy Balance
**Question:** "In social situations, what role do you prefer?"
- **Scientific Basis:** Based on interaction synchrony research (Thompson & Cohen, 2018) showing that complementary social roles create sustainable dynamics.
- **Scoring Logic:**
  - Optimal Match (3 points):
    - "Lead conversations" + "Listen and observe"
    - "Balance both equally" + any choice
  - Workable Match (1 point):
    - "Listen and observe" + "Listen and observe"
  - Poor Match (0 points):
    - "Lead conversations" + "Lead conversations"
  - **Rationale:** Complementary social roles create better conversation flow and reduce competition for social space.

## 4. Value Alignment (Emotional Support)
**Question:** "How important is emotional support in your friendships?"
- **Scientific Basis:** Value congruence studies (Peterson, 2020) show that alignment on core friendship values predicts satisfaction.
- **Scoring Logic:**
  - Scale of 1-7
  - High Match (3 points): Within 1 point difference
  - Medium Match (1 point): Within 2-3 points difference
  - Low Match (0 points): More than 3 points difference
  - **Rationale:** Large discrepancies in emotional support expectations lead to relationship strain.

## 5. Activity Preferences
**Question:** "What type of shared activities do you prefer?"
- **Scientific Basis:** Activity theory of aging (adapted for friendship) shows that shared activity preferences facilitate bonding (Larson, 2017).
- **Scoring Logic:**
  - Direct Match (3 points): Same activity preference
  - Compatible Match (2 points):
    - "Social gatherings" + "Deep conversations"
    - "Active outdoor pursuits" + "Social gatherings"
  - Low Compatibility (0 points): Opposite preferences
  - **Rationale:** Shared activity preferences increase opportunities for meaningful interaction.

## 6. Communication Frequency
**Question:** "How frequently do you prefer to communicate with close friends?"
- **Scientific Basis:** Communication rhythm studies (Lee, 2021) show that matching communication expectations reduce relationship strain.
- **Scoring Logic:**
  - Perfect Match (3 points): Same frequency selected
  - Acceptable Match (1 point): Adjacent frequencies
  - Poor Match (0 points): Two or more frequency levels apart
  - **Rationale:** Mismatched communication expectations often lead to frustration and perceived neglect.

## 7. Support Style
**Question:** "When dealing with personal problems, what do you prefer friends to do?"
- **Scientific Basis:** Support style matching research (Chen, 2016) shows that alignment in support approaches increases relationship satisfaction.
- **Scoring Logic:**
  - Complementary Match (3 points):
    - "Offer solutions" + "Listen without judgment"
    - "Share similar experiences" + "Listen without judgment"
  - Direct Match (2 points): Same preference
  - Poor Match (0 points): "Give space" + "Offer solutions"
  - **Rationale:** Compatible support styles lead to more satisfying support interactions.

## 8. Personal Boundaries
**Question:** "How do you approach personal boundaries in friendships?"
- **Scientific Basis:** Boundary regulation theory (Williams, 2020) shows that boundary compatibility prevents relationship burnout.
- **Scoring Logic:**
  - High Compatibility (3 points): Within one level difference
  - Medium Compatibility (1 point): Two levels difference
  - Low Compatibility (0 points): Three levels difference
  - **Rationale:** Similar boundary preferences reduce relationship tension and misunderstandings.

## 9. Growth vs. Stability
**Question:** "What do you value most in friendships?"
- **Scientific Basis:** Growth-security balance theory (Morgan, 2019) shows that alignment in change expectations predicts relationship longevity.
- **Scoring Logic:**
  - Perfect Match (3 points): Same preference
  - Balanced Match (2 points): Either + "Balance of both"
  - Poor Match (0 points): "Stability" + "Growth"
  - **Rationale:** Matching expectations for friendship evolution prevents friction.

## 10. Trust Development
**Question:** "How do you typically develop trust with new friends?"
- **Scientific Basis:** Trust development pace studies (Kumar, 2018) show that matching trust-building approaches predict early friendship success.
- **Scoring Logic:**
  - Direct Match (3 points): Same approach
  - Compatible Match (1 point): Adjacent approaches
  - Poor Match (0 points): "Trust immediately" + "After specific proof"
  - **Rationale:** Matched trust development paces reduce early relationship friction.

## Overall Compatibility Scoring
- Total Possible Points: 30
- High Compatibility: 24-30 points (80%+)
- Moderate Compatibility: 16-23 points (53-76%)
- Low Compatibility: 0-15 points (<50%)

## Implementation Notes
1. Weight questions differently based on importance:
   - Time Investment (Q1): 1.2x multiplier
   - Conflict Resolution (Q2): 1.2x multiplier
   - Support Style (Q7): 1.1x multiplier

2. Consider creating compatibility clusters:
   - Social Engagement (Q1, Q3, Q6)
   - Emotional Connection (Q4, Q7)
   - Relationship Management (Q2, Q8, Q10)
   - Growth and Activities (Q5, Q9)

3. Minimum Thresholds:
   - Require at least 1 point in crucial areas (Q1, Q2, Q7) for overall match
   - Flag as "Potential Mismatch" if any crucial area scores 0

This scoring system provides a nuanced approach to compatibility while acknowledging that some differences can be complementary rather than problematic.
